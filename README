# Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) with Image and Video Processing

This project processes images and videos to detect and recognize license plates using the OpenALPR API. Detected plates are annotated on the image or video frames and saved for review.

---

## Features
1. Process a single image for license plate detection.
2. Process video files to extract and analyze license plates from frames.
3. Automatically annotate and save the processed images or video frames with detected license plate information.
4. Interactive menu to choose images or videos for processing.
